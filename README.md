# Neural-Networks

This is an attempt to create Andrew NG's Coursera ML course for Neural Networks exercise in R

The code is inspired from Michael Nielsen's online book on Neural Networks.

It attempts to recreate the Python code in R. The code is not at all optimized and takes a long time to execute each epoch.

Only for conceptual understanding purpose
