# Neural-Networks

The code is inspired from Michael Nielsen's online book on Neural Networks.

It attempts to recreate the Python code in R. The code is not at all optimized and takes a long time to execute each epoch.

The data is taken from Andrew NG's course on Coursera

Only for conceptual understanding purpose.
